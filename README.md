Data scientist with a background in economy and finance. My path from traditional finance books to heavy machine learning tools has not been conventional but has left me with a strong desire to analyze and present data to uncover and demystify the field of Artificial Intelligence.

I have lifted books in school and weapons in the army. With a sergeant degree and master's degree, I have managed to combine two apparently different worlds to develop a personality with high drive and determination.
